This package contains the core modules for the NumPy Neural Network library.

Modules:
- layers: Building blocks of the network (Linear, ReLU, BatchNorm, etc.).
- losses: Loss functions (MSE, SoftmaxCrossEntropy).
- model: The Sequential model class that holds the layers.
- optimizer: Update rules for training (SGD, Momentum).
- solver: The training engine that runs the optimization loop.
- utils: Helper package for data, logging, and gradient checking.
